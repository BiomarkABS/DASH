Description: An R package companion to the Drone Assisted Stream Habitat protocol. Initial functionality provides 
    resources to import on-the-ground collected habitat data using the DASH protocol and data collection
    forms, perform quality control and assurance on that data, and then summarize the habitat data to an 
    appropriate scale for pairing with fish abundance and density information for various fish-habitat models, 
    including quantile random forest (QRF) capacity models. Additional functionality may include joining fish and
    habitat data with stream centerlines, tools to automate processing of drone-collected imagery, etc.
